# Homework 2

Discuss in your teams.

1. Why is client diversity important in ethereum?

    It is important that a blockchain can be language agnostic and more a set
    of protocols that must be followed, in case some implementation has an issue
    in the language implementation, it's more likely that one of the implementations
    gets not affected by that security issue.

2. How will you describe the following concepts, and how do you rank
them in terms of their importance to you

    - 2.1 TPS and transaction cost.

        TPS and transaction costs are an important for adoption, in the current blockchain competition.
        higher adoption can mean more incentives for development and decentralization.

    - 2.2 Finality
        
        Its important in terms of security that once a transaction is submitted to a blockchain
        either is a probabilistic like bitcoin or deterministic by consensus such as BFT based blockchains,
        ensures that the transaction will not be rolled back, and it will be an immutable state (permament)
        in the blockchain.

    - 2.3 Privacy

        Privacy is important in blockchains since it's one of the base concepts of cryptography
        and the main goal of the first version of blockchains such as bitcoin. Privacy ensures that
        sensitive information about individuals or companies does not get compromised, some other
        concepts can be selective transparency and confidential transactions that technologies
        such as zero knowledge cryptography can help with. Sadly right now it is one of the
        less implemented properties on most blockchains.
    
    - 2.4 Decentralisation

        Decentralization ensures there is no central authority which can control the 
        blockchain and that the blockchain follows the code as rules that everyone agree
        on participate when they use it. It is one of the most important parts of a
        blockhain since it provides Resilience, censorship resistance, trust minimization,
        and promotes inclusivity and empowerment for the end user.
 
    - 2.5 Security 

        A key property that secure blockchains should have, to ensure their correctness
        in the code execution and that it does what it intends to do, so that dangerous
        actors cannot perform manipulation fo make it execute in an incorrect way and
        thus take advantage of such systems, other properties that can ensure security 
        are immutability, transparency and verifiabilty such as FOSS code and standard 
        cryptographic implementations.
